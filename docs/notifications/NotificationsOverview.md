# Notifications Overview

Adaptive Live Tiles and interactive Toasts are key engagement components of a UWP Application on Windows 10.
Instead of having to deal with XML, you can now use Windows Community toolkit and its notification extensions to work with Tiles and notifications using a complete object model.

### Sending toasts from Win32 C# apps

If you're developing a non-UWP C# app for Windows, the Windows Community toolkit makes it easier to send an interactive toast notification from your Win32 C# app. To learn more, see [Send a local toast notification from desktop C# apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/shell/tiles-and-notifications/send-local-toast-desktop).
