## Contributing

Do you want to contribute or update the docs? Read the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)

When opening a PR, start by forking this repository. Then, based on the type of change you're making you'll need to create a new branch from either the `master` or `live` branches:

:new::books: For documentation for new features, please base your fork off the master branch.

:exclamation: If you have a typo or existing document improvement to an already shipped feature, please base your change off of the [live branch](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WindowsCommunityToolkitDocs/tree/live).  This will allow us to get the change to the published documentation between releases.

We will periodically merge updates from the live branch to master to keep master in-sync with the published docs.  When we make a new release, we will push master to the live branch in order to publish documentation for new features.
